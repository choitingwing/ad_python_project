Plotting data is always getting messy at the end.  

In this project, I would like to transform my previously developed code. I aim to create a plotting generator by transforming your code into a Python library and optimising your code for speed/memory usage.
If you open old_code.html or old_code.ipynb, you can see how messy that is. Everything is explicitly coded inside one file, from loading data, calculations, and 2D and 3D plottings.

In accelerator physics, particles are generated from some source before sending to an accelerator, or it is more like collecting the particles. Here, pions generated from a target are collected. To be able to collect them efficiently, we need to know the pion beam properties. In order to know that, we plot the pion data.



If that is too easy I am also interested in the Project 2 - The Traveling Salesperson Problem.
